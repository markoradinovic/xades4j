This page is **deprecated**. Starting on August 2012 I'll be using the _xades4j_ tag on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/xades4j) for Q & A.

Please use that tag for any doubts or small issues that may arise when using the library and are not appropriate for the "Issues" section. If some question becomes frequent it will be integrated on the appropriate wiki page.
